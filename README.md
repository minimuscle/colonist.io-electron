Welcome to the Colonist.io Electron adaptation. This application is **_unofficial_**. It runs Colonist.io that is usually a browser application, as its own dedicated application. This is the same way in which Discord runs its program. The main benefits of this is a larger screen, as it will hide the tabs and search bar, as they are not part of the program.

As it is just running a Chromium Browser, the experience should be mostly the same. Please let me know via the `issue-tracker` if there are any issues with the program.

## How to Use

Run the program. To close press F11 and then close like a normal program.
